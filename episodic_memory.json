Don't worry, it's an amazing game, but it can be overwhelming with all the characters, storylines, and gameplay mechanics.\n\nTo help you get back on track, here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Review the game's story**: Take some time to read through the in-game story and quest logs. This might help you understand the overall narrative and character connections.\n2. **Focus on a single character**: Choose a character you're interested in and focus on their story, abilities, and playstyle. This can make it easier to understand the game's mechanics and progression.\n3. **Explore the game's wiki or guides**: Websites like Genshin Impact Wiki or online forums can provide valuable information on characters, quests, and gameplay mechanics.\n4. **Watch gameplay videos or streams**: Watching others play the game can give you a better understanding of the gameplay and help you learn new strategies.\n\nIf you're still feeling lost, feel free to share more about what's confusing you, and I'll do my best to help you out.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your AI Writing Assistant]",
