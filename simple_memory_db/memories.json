However, I need more information to provide a specific response.\n\nIf you're using Streamlit, you can use the `os` module to list the files in the \"Downloads\" directory. Here's an example code snippet:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef list_downloads():\n    downloads_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Downloads')\n    files = os.listdir(downloads_dir)\n    return files\n\nfiles = list_downloads()\nst.write(files)\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, `os.path.expanduser('~')` is used to get the path to the user's home directory, and `os.path.join` is used to join the path to the \"Downloads\" directory. The `os.listdir` function is then used to list the files in the \"Downloads\" directory.\n\nIf you're running this code in a Streamlit app, you can use the `st.write` function to display the list of files.\n\nYou can also use the following code snippet to display the files in a more readable format:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef list_downloads():\n    downloads_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Downloads')\n    files = os.listdir(downloads_dir)\n    return files\n\nfiles = list_downloads()\nst.write(\"Files in Downloads directory:\")\nfor file in files:\n    st.write(file)\n```\n\nThis code snippet will display the list of files in a more readable format, with each file listed on a separate line.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to clarify anything!",
